# data-structures
Authors: Megan Slater, Tanner Lake, Tyler Peek

Summary:
A repository to hold sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python.


Linked List:
A singly linked list. Contains a Node class that holds a variable and a pointer to the next Node. Methods: __init__, __repr__, __str__, insert, pop, size, search, remove, display

Stack:
A Last In, First Out(LIFO) structure.  Contains a LinkedList that keeps track of the objects passed in. Methods: push, pop

Parethetics:
A function that takes in a string and:
	Return 1 if the string is "open" (there are open parens that are not closed)
	Return 0 if the string is "balanced" (there are an equal number of open and closed parentheses in the string)
	Return -1 if the string is "broken" (a closing parens has not been proceeded by one that opens) 
It also takes an optional argument of a string of two characters. The first will act as an opening symbol and the second as a closing symbol.

Queue:
A First In, First Out(FIFO) structure.  Contains a LinkedList that keeps track of the objects passed in as well as the size.  Methods:  enqueue, dequeue, size
